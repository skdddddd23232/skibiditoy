                        Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. Known as an "ice giant," it is a massive planet primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and traces of methane, which gives it its distinctive blue hue. Neptune has a thick atmosphere filled with dynamic weather systems, including some of the fastest winds in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 2,100 km/h (1,300 mph). Beneath its atmosphere lies a mantle of water, ammonia, and methane ices, surrounding a rocky core.
                        Neptune's average distance from the Sun is about 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles), and it takes 164.8 Earth years to complete one orbit. Despite being far from the Sun, it generates more heat than it receives, hinting at an internal heat source.
                        Neptune has 14 known moons, with the largest being Triton, a geologically active moon with icy volcanoes. The planet also has faint rings made of dust and ice particles, which are difficult to observe from Earth.

                            Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun, orbiting at an average distance of 57.9 million kilometers (36 million miles). Despite its diminutive size, just slightly larger than Earth's Moon, Mercury is incredibly dense, with a large metallic core that constitutes most of its volume. This rocky planet has no atmosphere, only a thin exosphere composed of atoms ejected by solar wind and meteoroid impacts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The planet's surface is heavily cratered and marked by vast plains and towering cliffs known as scarps, which formed as Mercury's core cooled and shrank. One of its most remarkable features is the Caloris Basin, a massive impact crater surrounded by mountain ranges. Mercury's lack of a substantial atmosphere causes extreme temperature variations, with daytime highs reaching 430°C (800°F) and nighttime lows plunging to -180°C (-290°F).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mercury completes a year in just 88 Earth days, making it the fastest-orbiting planet. However, its slow rotation (59 Earth days) and elliptical orbit result in a solar day lasting 176 Earth days. Despite its proximity to the Sun, ice exists in permanently shadowed craters at its poles.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Observed since ancient times, Mercury was named after the Roman messenger god for its swift movements across the sky. It has been studied up close by missions like Mariner 10 and MESSENGER, and further exploration is underway with ESA and JAXA's BepiColombo mission. As a planet of extremes, Mercury offers a unique glimpse into the Solar System's origins and the challenges of existing so close to the Sun.

It has an incredibly thick atmosphere, mostly made up of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, which create a runaway greenhouse effect. This effect causes surface temperatures to soar up to around 900°F (475°C), hotter than Mercury, even though Venus is farther from the Sun. Venus has a rocky, mountainous surface and features vast plains, large volcanic structures, and deep rift valleys. Despite its similarities to Earth, its harsh climate and crushing pressure (about 90 times greater than Earth's) make it uninhabitable.</p>
